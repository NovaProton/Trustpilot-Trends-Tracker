# Trustpilot Trends Tracker

**Trustpilot Trends Tracker** is a Google Apps Script tool that fetches daily TrustScore and review count data from Trustpilot for multiple furniture retailers and logs it in a Google Sheet. It also compares today's data with the previous day's to highlight changes in review volume.

## ‚ú® Features

- Scrapes TrustScore and total review counts from Trustpilot's UK site

## üß† How It Works

1. The script checks if a row for each company and date already exists.
2. It fetches each company's Trustpilot page and scrapes:
   - **TrustScore** (e.g. 4.6)
   - **Total Reviews** (e.g. 2,389)
3. Compares today's review count with yesterday's to compute growth.
4. Appends the new data to the Google Sheet:
   - `Name`, `Website`, `TrustScore`, `Total Reviews`, `Yesterday's Reviews`, `Day-over-Day Growth`, `Last Updated`

2. Go to **Extensions ‚Üí Apps Script**.
3. Paste the full script into the editor.
4. Save and run `fetchTrustpilotData()` (you may need to authorise access).
5. Schedule automatic runs with **Triggers** to capture daily changes.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- Make sure the header row exists (`Name`, `Website`, etc.) before the script is run.
- Trustpilot page structures may change, which could break parsing.
- This script scrapes HTML; API-based tracking is not used due to Trustpilot's limitations.
